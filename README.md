## üçé pantree food donation platform

Pantree is a web app focused on helping reduce food waste. Our goal is to establish a strong link between community fridges and local food businesses ‚Äì pantree does this by allowing potential donations to be listed for collection. Community fridge operators can claim any food donations which would otherwise go to waste. Our platform also allows local businesses to donate any surplus food to community fridges. With pantree, we aim to raise awareness of community fridges, bring communities together, and minimise food waste.

The web app has been designed by researching the users needs from a donation platform.
